The project involves preprocessing raw text data, extracting meaningful features, and building machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Multinomial Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machine to classify sentiments into positive, negative, or neutral categories. The performance of these models is evaluated to identify the most effective approach for sentiment prediction.\n","\n","# 📘 Explanation of the Objective (NLP-Based)\n","## 1. Use of Natural Language Processing (NLP)\n","NLP is used to enable machines to understand and process human language. In this project, NLP techniques help convert unstructured text into a structured format that machine learning models can understand.\n","\n","## 2. Text Preprocessing Using NLP Techniques\n","NLP preprocessing steps include:\n","\n","Tokenization\n","\n","Lowercasing\n","\n","Stopword removal\n","\n","Stemming or Lemmatization\n","\n","Removing punctuation and noise\n","\n","Feature extraction using Bag of Words or TF-IDF\n","\n","These steps improve text quality and model performance.\n","\n","## 3. Feature Extraction\n","NLP techniques are applied to extract numerical features from text, allowing machine learning algorithms to learn patterns related to sentiment.\n","\n","## 4. Machine Learning Model Training\n","The extracted features are used to train:\n","\n","Logistic Regression\n","\n","Multinomial Naive Bayes\n","\n","Support Vector Machine (SVM)\n","\n","Each model learns to classify text into positive, negative, or neutral sentiment categories.\n","\n","## 5. Model Evaluation\n","Models are evaluated using metrics such as:\n","\n","Accuracy\n","\n","Precision\n","\n","Recall\n","\n","F1-score\n","\n","This ensures reliable and fair comparison between different NLP-based models."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"4tq1-54CcmSR"},"source":["# Importing Libraries"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"id":"X4hLj0zYSq0d","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1767028522822,"user_tz":480,"elapsed":2701,"user":{"displayName":"Satyendra Singh","userId":"00406037497022970525"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["import pandas as pd\n","import numpy as np\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","import seaborn as sns\n","from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n","from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\n","from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer\n","from sklearn import metrics\n","from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report, confusion_matrix"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"u33e8upLcqGl"},"source":["# Load the Dataset"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":16397,"status":"ok","timestamp":1767028539225,"user":{"displayName":"Satyendra Singh","userId":"00406037497022970525"},"user_tz":480},"id":"lNwfBkHuStK7","outputId":"0ae9f618-0863-461d-ab24-ecae4140cd80"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Downloading from https://www.kaggle.com/api/v1/datasets/download/abhi8923shriv/sentiment-analysis-dataset?dataset_version_number=9...\n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["100%|██████████| 54.4M/54.4M [00:02<00:00, 21.7MB/s]"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Extracting files...\n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["\n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Path to dataset files: /root/.cache/kagglehub/datasets/abhi8923shriv/sentiment-analysis-dataset/versions/9\n"]}],"source":["import kagglehub\n","\n","# Download latest version\n","path = kagglehub.dataset_download(\"abhi8923shriv/sentiment-analysis-dataset\")\n","\n","print(\"Path to dataset files:\", path)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":3,"metadata":{"id":"VlelaeWVSviz","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1767028539542,"user_tz":480,"elapsed":313,"user":{"displayName":"Satyendra Singh","userId":"00406037497022970525"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["df = pd.read_csv(f\"{path}/train.csv\", encoding='latin1')"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":4,"metadata":{"id":"wan_SPyNS0Wr","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1767028539604,"user_tz":480,"elapsed":38,"user":{"displayName":"Satyendra Singh","userId":"00406037497022970525"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["data = df.iloc[:8000]"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"RaiNrvqFd6-y"},"source":["# Display top 5 records"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":5,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":345},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":513,"status":"ok","timestamp":1767028540140,"user":{"displayName":"Satyendra Singh","userId":"00406037497022970525"},"user_tz":480},"id":"3eP_I-z3cxqB","outputId":"b55d6380-7f08-4db4-dae3-baf61e530811"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["       textID                                               text  \\\n","0  cb774db0d1                I`d have responded, if I were going   \n","1  549e992a42      Sooo SAD I will miss you here in San Diego!!!
